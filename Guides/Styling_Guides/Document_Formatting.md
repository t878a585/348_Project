# Document Formatting

LAST UPDATED 9-15-2023

## Preface

Given the relative ease of use of Google Docs across multiple platforms, this guide will mostly focus on formatting that results in maximum compatibility with Google's defaults. In total, three types of documents will be supported: Google Docs, Microsoft Word, and Markdown documents. Since it is expected that we will use Google Docs the most. Most of our formatting will be Google Docs centric.

## Formatting

Microsoft Word and Google Docs share many features whereas Markdown does not. As such, the documentation will be divided into two sections.

### Microsoft Word and Google Docs

#### Note
When documents are given to us to fill out, we should use the preexisting formatting. Do not try to convert the formatting to our standard unless specifically asked for by the class.

#### Required

##### Page Formatting

- All margins (top, bottom, left, and right) should be 1 inch.
- The document should be in portrait mode in **ANSI Letter** format (8.5 x 11 inches): [Wikipedia (Letter (paper size))](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_%28paper_size%29)
- The document should never be set to any "Pageless" mode
- The **font** should be set to Arial 11
- Use single spacing

##### Top of Document Body

In every document, in left-justified non-bolded text at the top of the document, three lines will be needed:

\<Company_Name\>
\<Date\>
\<Document Creator\>

After these three initial lines, there should be an empty line and a line that follows in bolded 13 point Arial font. This will be the title of the document. After the title, there should be an empty line and then the document text. The empty line (and the following text) should be in 11 point non-bolded Arial.

#### Contextual

- If deemed necessary given the amount of pages, include the page number on the right hand side of the header.

### Markdown

Markdown doesn't allow for the same formatting control that Microsoft Word and Google Docs does. It is oftentimes used for How-To Guides or simple documentation. In general, all guides should be in Markdown. Outside of that, it will depend on the context.

#### Required

- There must only be one heading at the single '#' level (Ex, '# This is my Title')
- The heading described above should be the title
- The title must be less than three words
- A line should be present after the title that follows this format: `LAST UPDATED: <month>-<day>-<year>`

#### Contextual

- Different subheader levels should be included to make reading easier, but determining when to make a subheader will be up to you.
