# Note Taking Guide

**LAST UPDATED 9-15-2023**

## Preface

This is presently a living document. After multiple note taking sessions, we will have a better idea of the format that we will want to go with. For now, this will act as something that indicates what we must have.

## Requirements
All notes will go in the `Notes` folder. They should be labeled in the following format:

notes_\<month\>-\<day\>-\<year\>.\<extension\>

For example: `notes_9-15-2023.docx`

I talked with Saiedian directly, and he indicated that we should at least have the four following items present within our notes:

- The **time** it took place
- The **location** it took place
- **Who** was present
- **What** where the major points or decisions

Any notes taken should not lack these.

### Pictures

In the course of our meetings, we will likely need to make use of the whiteboard for taking notes. So that we have these on record, we need to take pictures of these notes. These should go at the bottom after all other text has been written.

## How to Upload Notes
